## Reflection

### 1. Steps in this project
    1. Create a GitHub account. (I already have one)
    2. Create a remote repository on the GitHub website.
    3. Clone the remote repo to a local repo using `git clone` command.
    4. Edit the `README.md` file locally using Markdown syntax, such as # for headings and - or * for bulleted lists.
    5. Create a text file locally in the repo, `practice.txt`.
    6. Use `git status` to check which files are being tracked by Git; it will indicate that one file in the local repo has not been tracked.
    7. Use `git add .` to stage the changes in the local repo.
    8. Use `git commit -m "Added README content and practice file"` to record the staged changes in the local repoâ€™s history, including a descriptive message.
    9. Use `git push origin main` to upload the local commits to the remote repository.
    10. Add a reflection section to the `README.md` file.
    11. Use `git add .`, `git commit -m "Added (updated) reflection"`, and `git push origin main` to update the remote repo with the new changes.

### 2. What I learned from Github workflow and using Markdown
    - I learned how to manage versions of my work systematically using GitHub, replacing messy file naming like V1/V2 with clear commit histories and branches. Markdown also helped me document projects in a clean, readable format, making collaboration and understanding easier.
