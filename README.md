## Reflection

1. **Steps in this project**
   * Create a GitHub account. (I already have one)
   * Create a remote repository on the GitHub website.
   * Clone the remote repo to a local repo using `git clone` command.
   * Edit the `README.md` file locally using Markdown syntax, such as # for headings and - or * for bulleted lists.
   * Create a text file locally in the repo, `practice.txt`.
   * Use `git status` to check which files are being tracked by Git; it will indicate that one file in the local repo has not been tracked.
   * Use `git add .` to stage the changes in the local repo.
   * Use `git commit -m "Added README content and practice file"` to record the staged changes in the local repoâ€™s history, including a descriptive message.
   * Use `git push origin main` to upload the local commits to the remote repository.
   * Add a reflection section to the `README.md` file.
   * Use `git add .`, `git commit -m "Added (updated) reflection"`, and `git push origin main` to update the remote repo with the new changes.

2. **What I learned from Github workflow and using Markdown**
    * I learned how to manage versions of my work systematically using GitHub, replacing messy file naming like V1/V2 with clear commit histories and branches. Markdown also helped me document projects in a clean, readable format, making collaboration and understanding easier.
